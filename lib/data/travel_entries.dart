        "The site consists of an exceptional urban setting encompassing the key natural elements that have shaped and inspired the development of the city: from the highest points of the Tijuca National Park’s mountains down to the sea. They also include the Botanical Gardens, established in 1808, Corcovado Mountain with its celebrated statue of Christ, and the hills around Guanabara Bay, including the extensive designed landscapes along Copacabana Bay which have contributed to the outdoor living culture of this spectacular city. Rio de Janeiro is also recognized for the artistic inspiration it has provided to musicians, landscapers and urbanists.",

        "A wildly romantic country that dances to a flamenco beat, Spain retains much of its traditional charm at the same time it embraces the new. As you tour Spain, you’ll find great Gothic cathedrals and Moorish palaces, but also sleek modern architecture and cutting-edge cuisines. Our specialists know Spain well and can provide new perspectives on the country’s highlights, from the cosmopolitan streets of Madrid to the wineries of La Rioja. We can also plan a Spain vacation that will help you dive deep into the country’s distinct regional cultures. Explore Moorish influences in Andalusia, touring the grandiose confines of the Alhambra. Or, you can discover the breadth of cuisine in the Basque Country, where you can enjoy pintxos (tapas on a skewer) and the gourmet offerings of San Sebastián. And, in Catalonia, you have the art and architecture of Barcelona, where the legacy of avant-garde minds like Gaudí, Picasso and Miró lives on.",
